      As the 2024-25 Women's Basketball season concludes and Men's season comes to an end, some games saw packed arenas 
      while others struggled to fill bleachers. Take a look at the attendance trends for both teams throughout the season.

      Women's Basketball attendance has dwindled in comparison to the Men's team, but notably, there was a spike on Jan. 28. 
      This away game was against Iowa, the home team of former player Caitlin Clark. Iowa's Carver-Hawkeye Arena has a capacity of over 15,000, 
      more than double the capacity of Northwestern's Welsh-Ryan Arena, which holds just 7,039. With the most popular Women's basketball team in 
      the nation, the turnout for Iowa was impressive, reaching 14,998 attendees.

        <!-- third paragraph   -->
    <p>
      Looking at only home games, the Women's team has not sold out any games and has barely reached the 4,000 attendance threshold. However, one should note that
      the Women's team play less games in a season.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p> I collected the attendance data from the Men's and Women's Basketball 2024-25 schedules that are publicly available.
        I cleaned the data into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jXFm5BK4QZaSYjplLdCYAm4bCPP7_umzgzb9MnRANqU/edit?usp=sharing" >Google Sheet</a> by removing unneeded variables, n/a values and created two seperate variables (Men's and Women's attendance respectively.) For 
        different visualizations, I filtered the data by location (home vs. away.) 
        I uploaded my data into Flourish to visualize it through line charts.
